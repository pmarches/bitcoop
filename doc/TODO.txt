Problem statement:
- No cheap backup solution for me. Even tarsnap runs into 150$/year!
- I can live with galicer speeds (wait 1 or 2 days before my restore is ready)
- Need crossplatform support
- Tarsnap looks nice, but no QR code support? :-(
- Uses S3 storage (0.25$/GB/Month) -> 50GB==150$/Year


What I like about tarsnap:
+ Client side encryption
+ Can pay with bitcoin
+ No file duplication
+ Content is separated from meta-data (Changing file perm or moving a file around does not require a re-upload)
- Single Threaded

Solution:
- Use glacier storage (0.01$/GB/Month) -> 50GB==6$/Year
- Multi-platform ->Java implementation, with native drivers for fast IO

Features:
- Possibility to move from glacier to P2PBlob
- Hash content & reference count to make fast uploads
- Git-like hash groups
-
